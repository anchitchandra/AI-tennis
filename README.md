# AI-tennis
AI-tennis is a simple game made with the help of unity-3D. it took me around 2 weeks to finish this project.
> The code part is done with c#.
> Assets and materials are for unity itself.

@ OVERVIEW: 
> In this game player follow ball by the help of movement script and to hit the ball person has to use his *mobile as racket/badminton* the movement of mobile is tracked through gyro script in which the code reades the movement of the mobile's gyro tho performe same action with the badminton in the game. W ith th help of that and some basic physics you can hit the ball as far as you try to stike it the force on the ball is directly proportional tho the speed at which you swing your mobile. and the opponent can do the same except for the fact it cannot be controlled by the gyro but with the help of *HITBOX* it will also follow the ball with the help of followballxy script. if the ball went outside the play area it will automatically spawn above the player.![Screenshot 2021-04-14 142333](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66684814/114682798-0cdf9300-9d2d-11eb-9e7a-ec8677e57111.png)
